# Smart vehicle booking system

### We anticipate the development of a software system for reserving smart bikes intended for on-campus transportation at IIIT-H. The design should support users in booking smart bikes via a mobile app and conducting payment transactions. Users should be able to complete the onboarding process, scan QR codes on bikes located in the parking lot to initiate and conclude trips, and facilitate payments manually or through an auto-deduct feature.
